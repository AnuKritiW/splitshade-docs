# iChannel0â€“iChannel3

The `iChannel` uniforms allow you to pass [**external textures**](../textures/what-are.md) into your shader. These are typically image samplers used for lookup, masking, layering, or stylized effects.

You can access up to **four channels** in your shader:  
`iChannel0`, `iChannel1`, `iChannel2`, and `iChannel3`.

In `WGSL`, textures and samplers are defined separately:
- `iChannelN`: `texture_2d<f32>`
- `iChannelNSampler`: `sampler`

`WGSL` separates the texture (`texture_2d<f32>`) and sampler (`sampler`)

Textures are sampled using normalized UV coordinates: `vec2<f32>` in the `[0.0, 1.0]` range.

Images are managed in the UI via the Texture Panel, where you can upload or assign textures per channel.

## Usage

Each channel is made up of two parts:
  - A 2D float texture: `texture_2d<f32>` (e.g., `iChannel0`)
  - A sampler: `sampler` (e.g., `iChannel0Sampler`)

To read from a texture, both the texture and its sampler must be passed to `textureSample`.

### Common Use Cases

- **Read a color from a texture**
  ```wgsl:no-line-numbers
  let color = textureSample(iChannel0, iChannel0Sampler, uv);
- **Use a texture as a mask**
  ```wgsl:no-line-numbers
  let mask = textureSample(iChannel1, iChannel1Sampler, uv).r;
  ```
- **Distort based on another texture**
  ```wgsl:no-line-numbers
  let offset = textureSample(iChannel2, iChannel2Sampler, uv).rg;
  ```

## Examples
All the example previews below assume the default textures uploaded in all four channels. 
### Display a Texture
![Display Texture](/images/ichannel-display.png)
```wgsl
@fragment
fn main(@builtin(position) pos: vec4<f32>) -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {
  let uv = pos.xy / iResolution.xy;
  return textureSample(iChannel0, iChannel0Sampler, uv);
}
```
This example simply maps the `iChannel0` texture directly to the screen using UV coordinates derived from `iResolution`.

### Masked Glow Using Second Texture
![Rotating Hue](/images/ichannel-glowmask.png)
```wgsl
@fragment
fn main(@builtin(position) pos: vec4<f32>) -> @location(0) vec4<f32> {
  let uv = pos.xy / iResolution.xy;
  let base = textureSample(iChannel0, iChannel0Sampler, uv);
  let mask = textureSample(iChannel1, iChannel1Sampler, uv).r;
  return vec4(base.rgb * mask, 1.0);
}
```
This example multiplies the base texture (`iChannel0`) by the red channel of a mask texture (`iChannel1`) to create a glowing masked effect.
