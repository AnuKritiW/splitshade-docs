# Getting Started

**Splitshade** runs entirely in the browser — no downloads, no setup.

## Requirements

All you need is a modern browser with [WebGPU support](https://caniuse.com/webgpu). We recommend using:

- **Google Chrome** (v113 or newer)
- **Microsoft Edge** (v113 or newer)

## Launch the Playground

You can start using Splitshade right away:

[**Open the Playground**](https://anukritiw.github.io/splitshade)

## How It Works

**Splitshade** opens with a real-time shader editor and preview panel. You can:

- Write `WGSL` [vertex](../shaders/vertex.md) and/or [fragment](../shaders/fragment.md) shaders
- Inject textures and meshes
- Use uniform values like `iTime`, `iMouse`, and `iResolution`

## Next Steps

Learn more about:

- To understand how built-in inputs like time, resolution, and mouse position work in Splitshade, start with the [Uniforms guide](../uniforms/what-are.md), where each uniform is explained with usage tips and shader examples.
- Want to load images or experiment with visual effects? Learn how to upload and apply textures in the [Textures section](../textures/what-are.md). For 3D shader workflows, head over to the [Meshes guide](../meshes/what-is.md) to see how `.obj` models can be used.
- If you’re looking for ideas or want to see what’s possible, browse the [Shader Examples](../examples/index.md) for inspiration.
